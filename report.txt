♥ Brief Description:
This dataset captures a wide spectrum of audio features, popularity metrics, and artist metadata for Amazon Music/Spotify-like tracks. It combines song-level attributes (e.g., duration, danceability, energy, valence, tempo, loudness, mode), artist-level characteristics (followers, genres, popularity), and contextual data (release date, explicit flag). It is designed to support exploratory analysis, clustering, and recommendation modeling, making it ideal for studying music similarity, genre trends, artist influence on popularity, and playlist generation.
Clustering techniques implemented:
- K-Means Clustering (partitional, optimal k = 4 via silhouette score)
- DBSCAN (density-based, eps=0.8, min_samples=5)
- Hierarchical Clustering (agglomerative, linkage=ward, n_clusters=4)

3. Recommendation System
Content-based approach using cosine similarity on audio features.
Key features: danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo
Example: For the original song (index 0), recommended songs from same cluster include 3 tracks with similar audio feature profiles.

4. Insights & Observations
- High-energy, high-valence clusters correlate with danceable tracks.
- High acousticness and instrumentalness dominate calm or experimental clusters.
- DBSCAN identifies outlier tracks effectively (though in this dataset noise=0).
- Hierarchical clustering reveals nested relationships between clusters.
- Cluster-based recommendations enhance playlist diversity.

Business Implications:
- Cluster-based playlists improve user engagement.
- Outliers highlight unique tracks for niche audiences.
- Cluster insights support targeted marketing and mood-based playlists.
